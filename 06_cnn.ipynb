    "Convolutional neural networks as very similar to the ordinary [feed-forward neural networks](05_neural_network.ipynb). They differ in the sense that CNNs assume explicitly that the inputs are images, which enables us to encode specific properties in the architecture to recognize certain patterns in the images. The CNNs make use of *spatial* nature of the data. It means, CNNs perceive the objects similar to our perception of different objects in nature. For example, we recognize various objects by their shapes, size and colors. These objects are combinations of edges, corners, color patches, etc. CNNs can use a variety of detectors (such as edge detectors, corner detectors) to interpret images. These detectors are called **filters** or **kernels**. The mathematical operator that takes an image and a filter as input and produces a filtered output (e.g. edges, corners, etc. ) is called **convolution**.\n",
