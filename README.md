# Machine Learning Concepts
> This project aims to create intuitive tutorials for some of machine learning concepts.


## Acknowlegement

I would like to give full credit to several outstanding individuals including Tom Mitchell, Andrew Ng, Emily Fox, Ali Farhadi, Pedro Domingos and many others, as lots of the materials presented here have been adopted from their machine learning courses.

## Topics
Topics are constantly updated and new tutorial is added. The current topics are:

[1- Introduction to MLE and MAP](mle_map)


2- Naive Bayes Classifier (coming soon)


[3- Linear Regression](linear_regression)


[4- Logistic Regression](logistic_regression)


[5- Neural Networks](neural_network)


[6- Convolutional Neural Networks](cnn)


[7- Autoencoders](autoencoder)
